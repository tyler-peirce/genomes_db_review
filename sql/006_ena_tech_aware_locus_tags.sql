-- Make the specimen locus registry prefix-free so one specimen can be published
-- once per sequencing technology.
--
-- Each technology has its own ENA study and therefore its own registered INSDC
-- locus-tag prefix:
--   hifi -> PRJEB123419 / OGMTHIFI
--   hic  -> PRJEB123420 / OGMTHIC
--   ilmn -> PRJEB123421 / OGMTILMN
--
-- A prefix belongs to exactly one study and a locus tag cannot be shared between
-- two published records, so the same specimen gene must render differently in
-- each per-tech record.  The registry therefore stores the specimen-level serial
-- only (OG910 gene 1 is serial 1 in every technology) and the rendered tag
-- OGMTHIFI_000910001 / OGMTHIC_000910001 / OGMTILMN_000910001 is produced per
-- candidate at allocation time from the tech of its full_seqid.
--
-- ena_candidate_loci keeps the resolved tag: that table is per package, so it is
-- the only place the tech-specific tag is recorded.
--
-- Run after 005_ena_validation_attempts_genome_context.sql via
-- bin/apply_ena_migrations.py.  Idempotent.

BEGIN;

-- The rendered-tag foreign key cannot survive a prefix-free registry.  The
-- composite (og_id, gene_serial) foreign key stays and is the real integrity
-- guarantee.  Drop by lookup rather than by generated name so this works on
-- databases where 004 was applied under a different constraint name.
-- Every catalogue lookup below is scoped with to_regclass() rather than by bare
-- relname or conname. Bare names match across every schema, so a migration
-- applied into a throwaway schema (as the integration test does) would find and
-- try to alter the copy in public.
