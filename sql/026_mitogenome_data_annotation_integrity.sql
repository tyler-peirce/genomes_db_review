-- Additive columns for the final annotation-integrity verdict, the lineage gene
-- expectations, the MITOS->EMMA conversion audit, graded gene order, and the two
-- non-vertebrate genes the pipeline now carries end to end (ATP9, mtMutS).
--
-- Purely additive: no existing column is altered or dropped, and every new column
-- is nullable, so an older annotation CSV that lacks them still uploads.
--
-- Freshness: annotation_stats.py always writes an explicit value ('ok'/'none')
-- into the status and issue columns on a successful run, never a blank, so NULL
-- here means "produced before this migration" rather than "clean". The uploader
-- refreshes all of them together whenever a complete row arrives, so a rerun that
-- fixes an annotation cannot leave a stale issue string behind.
--
-- Transaction control added 2026-10-02 (database_review.md Finding 10). This file
-- was originally applied by hand, out of band, and left no schema_migrations row --
-- partly because it was the only migration in the set without an explicit
-- BEGIN/COMMIT, which invited hand-application. Wrapping it brings it into line
-- with the rest of 001-029. Safe to re-run: every statement is
-- ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS or COMMENT ON, so a replay is a no-op.
